Wholphin Enhanced - A Custom Android TV Client for Jellyfin
Wholphin Enhanced is a heavily modified build of the open-source Wholphin Android TV client for Jellyfin. It includes a wide range of UI, playback, and quality-of-life improvements on top of the original app, with the goal of delivering a premium streaming experience on Android TV devices.

✨ What's New in Wholphin Enhanced
🎨 UI, Visuals & Navigation

Premium Visual Overhaul — Comprehensive UI tweaks across the entire app to modernize the interface, smooth out transitions, and give the application a polished, top-tier streaming service feel.
Revamped "Continue Playing" & "Next Up" — Completely redesigned how ongoing movies and upcoming TV episodes are displayed, making the layout more intuitive and visually appealing.
Genre Hubs — Dedicated Genre lists natively added to the Movies and TV Shows pages, allowing for deep, categorized browsing without needing to search manually.
Dedicated "My List" — A standard, easily accessible "My List" feature to queue up movies and shows for later viewing.
Custom Screensaver — A native screensaver that automatically triggers after 10 minutes of inactivity to protect TV displays.

🎮 Quality of Life & Controls

Long-Press to Favorite — Quickly add items to your favorites by long-pressing the select button on any poster.

📼 Playback & Media Engine

Direct Play by Default — Rewrote the player logic to prioritize Direct Play, ensuring maximum local network quality without unnecessarily stressing the Jellyfin server.
Granular Transcoding Presets — A custom video quality selector in the player lets you force specific transcode resolutions (e.g., stepping a 4K file down to 480p) to manage bandwidth constraints.
Quick Audio Switching — A dedicated, seamless button directly inside the playback UI to swap audio tracks and languages on the fly without interrupting the viewing experience.

🍿 SyncPlay (Watch Party) — Experimental

WebSocket Engine Integration — A custom background manager built using the Jellyfin SDK to listen for server commands, discover active network rooms, and maintain a localized UTC heartbeat.
Native UI Dialog — A custom popup menu that dynamically fetches open rooms and allows the user to join or create Watch Parties directly from the player.


Note: SyncPlay is currently in beta. It successfully discovers groups, joins rooms, tracks participant counts, and receives commands from the server. Final sync execution (perfectly matching timestamps and play/pause states across devices) is still being optimized.


📱 Compatibility
Requires Android 6+ (or Fire TV OS 6+) and Jellyfin server 10.10.x or 10.11.x.
